# Air Pollution Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning models based on various air pollutants. It helps in understanding pollution patterns and supports proactive environmental monitoring.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains monthly air quality data with the following features:
- PM2.5, PM10
- NOx, SO2, CO, O3
- NH3, Benzene
- AQI (target variable)

Some entries contain missing values, which are handled during preprocessing.

## 🧠 Models Used

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost  
- Ensemble Model (XGBoost + Random Forest)

## ⚙️ Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- AQI Prediction

## 📈 Results

The ensemble model (XGBoost + Random Forest) outperformed individual models in terms of accuracy and reliability.
